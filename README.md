Project_Tidy_Data
=================

For the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data we use the 
data 

        Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
        Version 1.0

We download this data, unzip it and run the R script 

        run_analysis.R

to get the tidy data set 

        tidy_data.txt
        
The code book contains all the details regarding the variables used and 
the steps performed to achieve the tidy data set.
